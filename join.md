If you miss Cohost just as much as everyone else, please <a class="button" href="https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/issues/new/choose">open a request</a> to add a new site through GitHub issues, or you can [email fluffy](mailto:fluffy%40beesbuzz%2ebiz?subject=Cohost+webring) with the following information:

* Your name
* Your website
* Your RSS/Atom feed, if any!
* An avatar icon/pfp (not currently supported but I will add that in at some point)

After you’re approved, you’ll need to add the webring code to your website:

{% include join-script.html %}
